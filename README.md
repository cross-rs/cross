</p>

## Features

- `cross` will provide all the ingredients needed for cross compilation without
  touching your system installation.

- `cross` provides an environment, cross toolchain and cross compiled libraries,
  that produces the most portable binaries.

- “cross testing”, `cross` can test crates for architectures other than i686 and
  x86_64.

- The stable, beta and nightly channels are supported.

## Dependencies

See our [Getting Started](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki/Getting-Started) guide
for detailed installation instructions.

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

- A Linux kernel with [binfmt_misc] support is required for cross testing.

[binfmt_misc]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/binfmt-misc.html

One of these container engines is required. If both are installed, `cross` will
default to `docker`.

- [Docker]. Note that on Linux non-sudo users need to be in the `docker` group or use rootless docker.
  Read the container engine [install guide][install] for the required installation and post-installation steps. Requires version 20.10 (API 1.40) or later.

[install]: https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki/Getting-Started#installing-a-container-engine

- [Podman]. Requires version 3.4.0 or later.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
```

It's also possible to directly download the pre-compiled [release
binaries](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/releases) or using
[cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).

## Usage

`cross` has the exact same CLI as [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
but relies on Docker or Podman. For Docker, you'll have to start
the daemon before you can use it.

```
# (ONCE PER BOOT, on Linux)
# Start the Docker daemon, if it's not already running using systemd
# on WSL2 and other systems using SysVinit, use `sudo service docker start`.
$ sudo systemctl start docker

# MAGIC! This Just Works
$ cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# EVEN MORE MAGICAL! This also Just Works
$ cross test --target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64

# Obviously, this also Just Works
$ cross rustc --target powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu --release -- -C lto
```

Additional documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki).

## Configuration

You have three options to configure `cross`. All of these options use the TOML format for configuration and the possible configuration values are documented [here](docs/cross_toml.md).

### Option 1: Configuring `cross` directly in your `Cargo.toml`

You can directly set [configuration values](docs/cross_toml.md) in your `Cargo.toml` file, under the `[package.metadata.cross]` table, i.e. key prefix.
An example config snippet would look like this:

```toml,cargo
[package.metadata.cross.target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
xargo = false
image = "test-image"
runner = "custom-runner"
```

### Option 2: Configuring `cross` via a `Cross.toml` file

You can put your [configuration](docs/cross_toml.md) inside a `Cross.toml` file in your project root directory.

### Option 3: Using `CROSS_CONFIG` to specify the location of your configuration

By setting the `CROSS_CONFIG` environment variable, you can tell `cross` where it should search for the config file. This way you are not limited to a `Cross.toml` file in the project root.

### Custom Docker images

`cross` provides default Docker images for the targets listed below. However, it
can't cover every single use case out there. For other targets, or when the
default image is not enough, you can use the `target.{{TARGET}}.image` field in
`Cross.toml` to use custom Docker image for a specific target:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
image = "my/image:tag"
```

In the example above, `cross` will use a image named `my/image:tag` instead of
the default one. Normal Docker behavior applies, so:

- Docker will first look for a local image named `my/image:tag`

- If it doesn't find a local image, then it will look in Docker Hub.

- If only `image:tag` is specified, then Docker won't look in Docker Hub.

- If only `tag` is omitted, then Docker will use the `latest` tag.

#### Dockerfiles

If you're using a custom Dockerfile, you can use `target.{{TARGET}}.dockerfile` to automatically build it

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
dockerfile = "./path/to/where/the/Dockerfile/resides"
```

`cross` will build and use the image that was built instead of the default image.

It's recommended to base your custom image on the default Docker image that
cross uses: `ghcr.io/cross-rs/{{TARGET}}:{{VERSION}}` (where `{{VERSION}}` is cross's version).
This way you won't have to figure out how to install a cross C toolchain in your
custom image.


``` Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/cross-rs/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu:main

RUN dpkg --add-architecture arm64 && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install --assume-yes libfoo:arm64
```

If you want cross to provide the `FROM` instruction, you can do the following

``` Dockerfile
ARG CROSS_BASE_IMAGE
FROM $CROSS_BASE_IMAGE

RUN ...
```

#### Pre-build hook

`cross` enables you to add dependencies and run other necessary commands in the image before using it.
This action will be added to the used image, so it won't be ran/built every time you use `cross`.

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
pre-build = ["dpkg --add-architecture arm64 && apt-get update && apt-get install --assume-yes libfoo:arm64"]
```

### Docker in Docker

When running `cross` from inside a container, `cross` needs access to
the hosts docker daemon itself. This is normally achieved by mounting the
docker daemons socket `/var/run/docker.sock`. For example:

```
$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v .:/project \
  -w /project my/development-image:tag cross build --target mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64
```

The image running `cross` requires the rust development tools to be installed.

With this setup `cross` must find and mount the correct host paths into the
container used for cross compilation. This includes the original project directory as
well as the root path of the parent container to give access to the rust build
tools.

To inform `cross` that it is running inside a container set `CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER=true`.

A development or CI container can be created like this:

```
FROM rust:1

# set CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER to inform `cross` that it is executed from within a container
ENV CROSS_CONTAINER_IN_CONTAINER=true

# install `cross`
RUN cargo install cross

...

```

**Limitations**: Finding the mount point for the containers root directory is
currently only available for the overlayfs2 storage driver. In order to access
the parent containers rust setup, the child container mounts the parents
overlayfs. The parent must not be stopped before the child container, as the
overlayfs can not be unmounted correctly by Docker if the child container still
accesses it.


### Explicitly choose the container engine

By default, `cross` tries to use [Docker] or [Podman], in that order.
If you want to choose a container engine explicitly, you can set the
binary name (or path) using the `CROSS_CONTAINER_ENGINE`
environment variable.

For example in case you want use [Podman], you can set `CROSS_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`.

### Passing environment variables into the build environment

By default, `cross` does not pass most environment variables into the build environment from the calling shell. This is chosen as a safe default as most use cases will not want the calling environment leaking into the inner execution environment. There are, however, some notable exceptions: most environment variables `cross` or [cargo reads](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-reads) are passed through automatically to the build environment.

In the instances that you do want to pass through environment variables, this
can be done via `build.env.passthrough` in your `Cross.toml`:

```toml
[build.env]
passthrough = [
    "RUST_BACKTRACE",
    "RUST_LOG",
    "TRAVIS",
]
```

To pass variables through for one target but not others, you can use
this syntax instead:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.env]
passthrough = [
    "RUST_DEBUG",
]
```

For more detailed documentation on which environment variables are automatically passed to the build environment, see [Environment Variable Passthrough](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross/wiki/Configuration#environment-variable-passthrough) on our wiki.

### Unstable Features

Certain unstable features can enable additional functionality useful to
cross-compiling. Note that these are unstable, and may be removed at any
time (particularly if the feature is stabilized or removed), and will
only be used on a nightly channel.

- `CROSS_UNSTABLE_ENABLE_DOCTESTS=true`: also run doctests.

### Mounting volumes into the build environment

In addition to passing environment variables, you can also specify environment
variables pointing to paths which should be mounted into the container:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.env]
volumes = [
    "BUILD_DIR",
]
```

### Use Xargo instead of Cargo

By default, `cross` uses `xargo` to build your Cargo project only for all
non-standard targets (i.e. something not reported by rustc/rustup). However,
you can use the `build.xargo` or `target.{{TARGET}}.xargo` field in
`Cross.toml` to force the use of `xargo`:

```toml
# all the targets will use `xargo`
[build]
xargo = true
```

Or,

```toml
# only this target will use `xargo`
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
xargo = true
```

`xargo = false` will work the opposite way (pick cargo always) and is useful
when building for custom targets that you know to work with cargo.

## Supported targets

A target is considered as “supported” if `cross` can cross compile a
“non-trivial” (binary) crate, usually Cargo, for that target.

Testing support (`cross test`) is more complicated. It relies on [QEMU]
emulation, so testing may fail due to QEMU bugs rather than bugs in your crate.
That said, a target has a ✓ in `test` column of the table below if it can run
the [`compiler-builtins`] test suite.

[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org/
[`compiler-builtins`]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/compiler-builtins

Also, testing is very slow. `cross test` runs units tests *sequentially* because
QEMU gets upset when you spawn multiple threads. This means that, if one of your
unit tests spawns threads, then it's more likely to fail or, worst, never
terminate.

<!--[7] libc = emscripten and GCC = clang. The Docker images for these targets are currently not built automatically
due to a [compiler bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98216), you will have to build them yourself for now.-->

Additional Dockerfiles for other targets can be found in [cross-toolchains](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross-toolchains).
These include MSVC and Apple Darwin targets, which we cannot ship pre-built images of.

## Debugging

### QEMU_STRACE (v0.1.9+)

You can set the QEMU_STRACE variable when you use `cross run` to get a backtrace
of system calls from “foreign” (non x86_64) binaries.

```
$ cargo new --bin hello && cd $_

$ QEMU_STRACE=1 cross run --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
9 brk(NULL) = 0x0000004000023000
9 uname(0x4000823128) = 0
(..)
9 write(1,0xa06320,14)Hello, world!
 = 14
9 sigaltstack(0x4000823588,(nil)) = 0
9 munmap(0x0000004000b16000,16384) = 0
9 exit_group(0)
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.64.0 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

Some cross-compilation targets require a later Rust version, and using Xargo
requires a nightly Rust toolchain.
